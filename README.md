Push notifications are short messages that pop up on the userâ€™s mobile or desktop and they are designed to catch the user's attention by prompting him to take some action. In short, push notifications are alerts that are "pushed" to the devices by apps, even when those apps aren't open.

This project is the design and the implementation of an application that sends push notifications to an android device depending on the customer's position in a store. 
The user of the application has the ability to decide when he wants to receive a notification, by subscribing to the categories in which he is interested. 
For the practical part of the work, the application was developed in native Android using Android Studio and writing in Java code. Also, I used the OneSignal API for sending push notifications, the RabbitMQ service for receiving messages from an another project (critical events) and the MySQL database for storing and searching information.
